me# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept. 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Git and GitHub Master Class from Udemy. I reviewed section 2 again and went through the creation of a git and github library.

**Thoughts:** Seeing that git and git hub are used by most developers I feld the need to review the course to make sure I understand what I'm doing and what I need to do going forward. 

### Day 1: Sept. 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I completed 7 sections (15 - 21) of the Git and GitHub Master class. The material covered was an intro to forking and how to use several git commands (log, show and HEAD) to find out information about a particular repository. I also started the Product Landing Page project (https://codepen.io/fwdawg74/pen/mdmMdQE). 

**Thoughts:** I found the class sessions very useful as they gave me some idea on how to git commands to research changes, etc. to a repository. I'm sure at this point how much I will use them because I'm a one man team but it is good to know. 
As for the Free Code Camp project I am going to have to go back through the CSS section because I am not sure how to do certain things with CSS to make the page look like the example that is provided. I really don't want to just copy what is provided, I want to learn it myself

### Day 2: Sept. 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Contunied working on the Git and GitHub Master class. Completed sections 22-24 which covered how to recover from incorrect code changes that have committed and pushed to one's repository. I've also decided that I need to go back and review the Basic CSS section of the Responsive Web Design Certification course on Free Code Camp. I'm doing this because I am struggling with the Product Page project. 

**Thoughts:** I am contemplaing starting over with FCC
